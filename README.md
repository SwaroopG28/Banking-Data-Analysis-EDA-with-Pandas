# Banking Data Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a banking dataset using **Pandas** to uncover patterns and insights. EDA is a crucial step in understanding the characteristics and trends within data, helping to inform future analysis and decision-making.

## Key Features
- Conducts **data cleaning** to handle missing values, correct data types, and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- Performs **descriptive statistics** and visualization to explore the distribution, relationships, and trends in the data.
- Analyzes specific banking-related metrics to gain insights into customer demographics, transactions, and financial behaviors.
- Utilizes **data visualization** to showcase important findings and patterns within the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for development.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating data visualizations.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the banking dataset through EDA, generating actionable insights that can support data-driven decision-making.
